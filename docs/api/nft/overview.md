# What is Uniswap NFT?

Uniswap NFT is an Aggregated Orderbook that enables buying, listing and selling NFTs across a growing number of 1st party marketplaces (including OpenSea, X2Y2, Rarible and more). 

You can now embed the same aggregated NFT functionality available in the [Uniswap web app](https://app.uniswap.org/#/nfts) directly into your own application with our easy to integrate API and SDKs!
